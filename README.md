# Bootstrapping

Tutorial materials for a workshop on bootstrapping. 

In this repository, you will find the workshop slides, as well as supplementary python and R scripts. The python scripts are presented in a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org), and the R scripts in [R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). 

If you're focusing on python during this session, I recommend installing Jupyter (instructions in the notebook) and opening the `.ipynb` files with that. This will allow you to interact with the scripts directly in the notebook. Otherwise you can simply copy+paste the relevant python code into whatever editor you usually use for your python scripts. If you don't have one yet, I quite like [Atom](https://atom.io). 

If you're focusing on R, just open the `.Rmd` file in [R studio](https://www.rstudio.com), or view the `.md` file online here.

I will focus on python in session 1 and R in session 2.
