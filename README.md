# bootstrapping
Tutorial materials for a workshop on bootstrapping. 

In this repository, you will find the workshop slides, as well as supplementary python and R scripts. The python scripts are presented in a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org), and the R scripts in [R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). If you're focusing on python during this session, I recommend installing Jupyter (instructions in the notebook). If you're focusing on R, you don't need to install anything (assuming you already have R studio), because R markdown isn't as interactive as Jupyter notebooks.
